{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:"}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:"}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil."}

{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?"}

{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"From the Apocrypha: Bel and the Dragon."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And king Astyages was gathered to his fathers, and Cyrus of Persia received his kingdom."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And Daniel conversed with the king, and was honoured above all his friends."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Now the Babylonians had an idol called Bel: and there were spent upon him every day twelve great measures of fine flour, and forty sheep, and six vessels of wine."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And the king worshipped it and went daily to adore it: but Daniel worshipped his own God. And the king said unto him, Why dost not thou worship Bel?"}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Who answered and said, Because I may not worship idols made with hands, but the living God, who hath created the heaven and the earth, and hath sovereignty over all flesh."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Then said the king unto him, Thinkest thou not that Bel is a living god? seest thou not how much he eateth and drinketh every day?"}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Then Daniel smiled, and said, O king, be not deceived: for this is but clay within, and brass without, and did never eat or drink anything."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"So the king was wroth, and called for his priests, and said unto them, If ye tell me not who this is that devoureth these expenses, ye shall die."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"But if ye can certify me that Bel devoureth them, then Daniel shall die: for he hath spoken blasphemy against Bel. And Daniel said unto the king, Let it be according to thy word."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Now the priests of Bel were threescore and ten, beside their wives and children. And the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"So Bel’s priests said, Lo, we go out: but thou, O king, set on the meat, and make ready the wine, and shut the door fast, and seal it with thine own signet:"}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And tomorrow when thou comest in, if thou findest not that Bel hath eaten up all, we will suffer death: or else Daniel, that speaketh falsely against us."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And they little regarded it: for under the table they had made a privy entrance, whereby they entered in continually, and consumed those things."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"So when they were gone forth, the king set meats before Bel. Now Daniel had commanded his servants to bring ashes, and those they strewed throughout all the temple in the presence of the king alone: then went they out, and shut the door, and sealed it with the king’s signet, and so departed."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Now in the night came the priests with their wives and children, as they were wont, and did eat and drink up all."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"In the morning betimes the king arose, and Daniel with him."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And the king said, Daniel, hath Bel eaten up the meat? And Daniel said, O king, live for ever."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"But look upon the pavement, and mark well whose footsteps are these."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And the king said, I see the footsteps of men, women, and children. And then the king was angry,"}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And took the priests with their wives and children, who shewed him the privy doors, where they came in and consumed such things as were upon the table."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Therefore the king slew them, and delivered Bel into Daniel’s power, who destroyed him and his temple."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And in that same place there was a great dragon, which they of Babylon worshipped."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And the king said unto Daniel, Wilt thou also say that this is of brass? lo, he liveth, he eateth and drinketh; thou canst not say that he is no living god: therefore worship him."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Then said Daniel unto the king, I will worship the Lord my God: for he is the living God."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"But give me leave, O king, and I shall slay this dragon without sword or staff. And the king said, I give thee leave."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Then Daniel took pitch, and fat, and hair, and did seethe them together, and made lumps thereof: this he put in the dragon’s mouth, and so the dragon burst in sunder: and Daniel said, Lo, these are the gods ye worship."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"When they of Babylon heard that, they took great indignation, and conspired against the king."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"So the king saw that they pressed him sore, being constrained, he delivered Daniel unto them:"}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Who cast him into the lions’ den: where he was six days."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And in the den there were seven lions, and they had given them every day two carcasses and two sheep: which then were not given to them, to the intent they might devour Daniel."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Now there was in Jewry a prophet, called Habakkuk, who had made pottage, and had broken bread in a bowl, and was going into the field, for to carry it to the reapers."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"But the angel of the Lord said unto Habakkuk, Go, carry the dinner that thou hast into Babylon unto Daniel, who is in the lions’ den."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And Habakkuk said, Lord, I never saw Babylon; neither do I know where the den is."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Then the angel of the Lord took him by the hair of the head, and carried him by the hair of his head, and through the vehemency of his spirit set him in Babylon over the den."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And Habakkuk cried, saying, O Daniel, Daniel, take the dinner which God hath sent thee."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And Daniel said, Thou hast remembered me, O God: neither hast thou forsaken them that seek thee and love thee."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"So Daniel arose, and did eat: and the angel of the Lord set Habakkuk in his own place again immediately."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Upon the seventh day the king went to bewail Daniel: and when he came to the den, he looked in, and behold, Daniel was sitting."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Then cried the king with a loud voice, saying, Great art thou, O Lord God of Daniel, and there is none other beside thee."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And he drew him out, and cast those that were the cause of his destruction into the den: and they were devoured in a moment before his face."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"A gentle knight rode forth upon the plain, bearing a red cross upon his shield."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Beside him went fair Una, a lady pure and true, guiding his quest with heavenly grace."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"They entered a dark wood, where shadows thickened and the path grew perilous."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Long they wandered, till they came upon a den where dwelt a monstrous creature called Error."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The beast was half serpent and half woman, with a brood of young that clung about her."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight drew his sword and struck boldly, but Error coiled round him with her tail."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"She spewed forth foul vomit of books and papers, choking the air with lies and poison."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight faltered, but Una cried to him to trust in God and strike again."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"With renewed strength he smote the monster’s head, cleaving it in twain."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Her brood, seeing their mother slain, fled shrieking into the wilderness."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Thus was Error destroyed, and the knight emerged victorious, guided still by Una’s truth."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"They pressed onward through the forest, though the path was tangled and uncertain."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Soon they encountered a hermit, who seemed holy and wise, offering them shelter."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"But this was Archimago, a false enchanter, who plotted deceit against the knight."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"He conjured spirits to weave illusions, crafting false dreams to ensnare the knight’s mind."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"In visions the knight beheld Una unfaithful, and his heart was troubled."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Archimago rejoiced in his craft, for he had sown discord between truth and holiness."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight, deceived, turned away from Una, though she remained pure and steadfast."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Una wept, yet trusted still in God, and continued her path alone."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Night fell, and the enchanter prepared his mischief, bidding wicked sprites to his service."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"He sent one spirit down to the dusky halls of sleep, where Morpheus keeps his drowsy court."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"There the sprite gathered a dream, heavy with false delight and treacherous show."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Returning swift, it laid the dream upon the knight, whispering soft delusion in his ear."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Archimago then shaped a false semblance of Una, fair in face but foul in will."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Beside her he set another sprite, feigning as a lewd squire, to play the paramour."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"They acted a wanton scene, with stolen kisses and unchaste embrace."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Awaking, the knight beheld the counterfeit, and his heart was pierced with grief and wrath."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"He turned his eyes from truth, not knowing he gazed upon a mask of lies."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Una slept in innocence, unknowing of the treachery that worked beside her."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The false pair withdrew as dawn drew nigh, leaving the knight in a storm of doubt."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Ere sunrise, he rose in haste, and with a heavy spirit took up his arms."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"He looked upon Una, yet suspicion veiled his sight, and he would not trust."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Without farewell, he left the place, riding through the misted wood alone."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Archimago, spying his departure, smiled darkly, for his net had snared the prey."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The enchanter then pursued at distance, weaving further wiles to deepen the divide."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Una awoke and found the knight departed, and sorrow weighed her gentle breast."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"She called his name among the trees, but only echoes answered in the leaves."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Her tears fell like dew upon the grass, yet steadfastly she prayed for his return."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The wood grew wild with briar and thorn, as if the very path conspired against her."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Still she held to truth, the only light in that dark maze of ill intent."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Meanwhile the knight rode swift, seeking to escape the thought that wounded him."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"His shield, though bright, seemed heavy; his helm, though strong, pressed hard upon his brow."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"He remembered his victory over Error, yet doubt gnawed like a hidden worm."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"From shadowed thickets, Archimago loosed new phantoms to dog the knight’s steps."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"They whispered flatteries and fears, now praising his zeal, now pricking his pride."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The enchanter posed as a holy guide, offering counsel that crooked truth to his design."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"He told of dangers that Una would bring, and of safer paths that led elsewhere."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Thus with honeyed speech he fed the knight’s suspicion, as bees are lured to poison-sweet."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight, unpractised in the arts of guile, mistook the serpent’s hiss for wisdom’s voice."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"He vowed to prove his holiness alone, as if truth were a burden he must lay aside."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"So virtue walked unyoked from truth, and stumbled where it should have stood upright."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Una, patient in her grief, kept faithful course, though the forest mocked her with winding ways."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"She prayed that light might pierce her path, and that the knight be guarded from ill."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Birds ceased their morning song as clouds drew low, foretelling trials yet to come."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Archimago, tireless in malice, prepared new masks to lead the knight astray."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"He dressed lies in robes of truth, and set falsehood upon a borrowed throne."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"He taught the knight to doubt his guide, and to lean upon his own uncertain will."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Thus was the seed of ruin sown, watered by pride, and warmed by jealousy’s sun."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight pressed onward, hearing only the echo of his wounded thought."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"His courage, though great, lacked the counsel that makes valour wise."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"So ends the first trial with Error slain, yet begins the subtler war with seeming good."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"For monsters of the den are easily known, but those that wear fair faces are harder to discern."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"And in that dark wood, truth and holiness parted ways, not by fate, but by deceit."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight approached the dragon’s lair, his heart steadfast though the ground trembled beneath him."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The beast lay stretched in dreadful length, scales glistening like iron and wings vast as clouds."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Its eyes burned like twin furnaces, casting sparks upon the air with every glance."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The dragon rose, shaking the earth, and roared so loud that the heavens quaked."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight lifted his shield, bearing the red cross, and advanced with sword in hand."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The dragon rushed forward, full of fire and greedy hardiment, bent on devouring him."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Its fiery head struck with force, the noise resounding like thunder across the firmament."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight smote upon the monster’s scaly hide, sparks flying from the blow."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The beast recoiled with a dreadful cry, yet from its mouth issued flames of fire."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The flames scorched the ground, burning grass and stone, and singed the knight’s armour."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight pressed on, though wounded sore, trusting in God for strength."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The dragon struck with its tail, sweeping the knight aside and casting him down."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"He lay bruised upon the earth, yet rose again, his spirit unbroken."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The beast spread its wings, darkening the sky, and descended with crushing might."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight raised his shield, and the dragon’s claws scraped upon the iron cross."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The battle raged from dawn till dusk, neither yielding, both fierce in strength."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"At last the knight stumbled near a well of living water, clear and pure."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"He drank and was refreshed, his wounds healed by the holy spring."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Renewed, he rose with vigour, and struck the dragon with mighty force."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The beast roared, shaking mountains, yet the knight stood firm."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"On the second day the dragon renewed its fury, striking with tail and claw."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight was cast down again, his armour rent and body sorely bruised."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Yet near him grew a sacred tree, whose balm healed his wounds."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"He rested beneath its shade, and strength returned to his weary limbs."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The dragon circled above, breathing fire, but the knight rose undaunted."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"He struck the beast’s wing, cleaving through the sinews, and it fell to earth."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The ground shook with its fall, dust rising like smoke from the plain."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight pressed his advantage, driving his blade into the dragon’s side."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The monster writhed in agony, its roar echoing across the land."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"On the third day the dragon gathered its strength for a final assault."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"It opened its jaws wide, flames pouring forth like rivers of fire."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight lifted his shield, the cross shining bright against the blaze."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"He prayed for divine aid, and courage filled his heart anew."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"With a swift stroke he pierced the dragon’s throat, driving deep into its flesh."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Blood poured forth, and the beast staggered, its strength failing."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The dragon fell lifeless to the earth, its body stretched across the plain."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The land was delivered, freed from terror and fire."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Una rejoiced, her prayers answered, and truth restored to its place."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The people came forth, praising the knight for his victory."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Songs were sung of the dragon slain, and of holiness triumphant."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight gave thanks to God, knowing his strength was not his own."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"He stood beside Una, their bond renewed by trial and triumph."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The land flourished once more, fields green and rivers clear."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The terror of the dragon was remembered only in tale and song."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight’s armour bore scars of battle, yet his spirit shone brighter."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Una’s faith had guided him, and together they stood as symbols of truth and holiness."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The people crowned him their champion, defender of the land and slayer of the beast."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The dragon’s carcass lay as proof of victory, its scales dull and lifeless."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Children played in safety, no longer fearing fire or claw."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight rested, his quest fulfilled, though greater duties yet awaited him."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Una smiled, her sorrow turned to joy, for truth had prevailed."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The heavens seemed brighter, as if creation itself rejoiced in the triumph."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight’s name was honoured, his deeds proclaimed in every hall."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Thus ended the battle with the dragon, a tale of courage and divine aid."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight prepared to continue his service to the Faerie Queene."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Una remained by his side, steadfast companion and guide."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Together they looked to the future, where new trials would surely rise."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"But for that moment, peace reigned, and the land was free."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The dragon’s fall marked the triumph of holiness over evil."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"The knight’s wounds bore witness to the cost of victory."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Yet his spirit was unbroken, his faith unshaken, his courage proven."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"So the tale of the dragon fight was told, and the knight’s glory endured."}
{"input":"[STYLE]","output":"Thus Canto XI closed, with triumph, thanksgiving, and the promise of greater quests to come."}

{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "'On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before'."}
{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "Then the bird said, 'Nevermore'."}
{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, 'Doubtless,' said I, 'what it utters is its only stock and store'."}

{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "'Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore'."}
{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "'Of Never—nevermore'."}
{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling, straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door."}
{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore, what this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore meant in croaking 'Nevermore'."}
{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core."}
{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining on the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er."}
{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er, she shall press, ah, nevermore."}
{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor."}
{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "'Wretch,' I cried, 'thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore'."}
{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "'Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore'."}
{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore'."}

{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "'Is there—is there balm in Gilead—tell me—tell me, I implore'."}
{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore'."}
{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "'Prophet,' said I, 'thing of evil—prophet still, if bird or devil, by that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore'."}
{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "'Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore'."}
{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "'Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore'."}
{"input": "[STYLE]", "output": "Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore'."}
